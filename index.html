					<h2> Elephant</h2>
					<p> "The Indian elephant is one of the largest land mammals on Earth. Asian elephants are mainly 
						found across India and Sri Lanka and towards the south and east as far as Sumatra.
						Asian elephants are smaller than African elephants and have the highest body point on the head. 
						The tip of their trunk has one finger-like process.Their back is convex or level.
						<strong>Indian elephants</strong> reach a shoulder height of between 2 and 3.5 m,weigh between 4,400 and 11,000 lb.
						Their skin color is lighter than of maximus with smaller patches of depigmentation.
						Females are usually smaller than males, and have short or no tusks.
						Elephants are classified as megaherbivores and consume up to 150 kg (330 lb) of plant matter per day.
						Elephants were recorded to feed on 112 different plant species, most commonly of the order Malvales, 
						and the legume, palm, sedge and true grass families." </p>

                   <h2>Yak</h2> 
                   <p>" Yaks belong to the genus Bos grunniens ("grunting ox") and are therefore related to cattle.
                        The yak may have diverged from cattle at any point between one and five million years ago, and there 
                        is some suggestion that it may be more closely related 
                        to bison than to the other members of its designated genus.They are
                        heavily built animals with a bulky frame, sturdy legs, and rounded cloven hooves, and extremely dense, long fur that hangs down lower than the belly. While wild yaks are generally dark, blackish to brown, in colouration, domestic yaks can be quite variable in colour, often having patches of rusty brown and cream. 
                        They have small ears and a wide forehead, with smooth horns that are generally dark in colour.
                        Both sexes have long shaggy hair with a dense woolly undercoat over the chest, flanks, and thighs to insulate them from the cold.
                        yaks do not thrive at lower altitudes,[12] and begin to suffer from heat exhaustion above about 15&#176;C (59&#176;F). 
                        Further adaptations to the cold include a thick layer of subcutaneous fat, and an almost complete lack of functional sweat glands."

				   <h2>Rhinoceros</h2>
					<p>"The Indian rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis), also called the greater one-horned rhinoceros and great Indian rhinoceros,
						is a rhinoceros native to the Indian subcontinent.The modern scientific designation Rhinoceros unicornis is
						 adopted from the Greek: &rho;&iota;&nu;&oacute- (&#34;rhino-&#34;&minus;nose) and -&kappa;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&ccedil; (&#34;keros&#34;&minus;horn of an animal) and Latin: "uni-" meaning single and "-cornis" meaning horn.
						 The one-horned rhinoceros is monotypic.Moreover, the extent and quality of the rhino's most important habitat, alluvial grassland and riverine forest, 
						 is considered to be in decline due to human and livestock encroachment."
